# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analyzing how different kickstarter campaigns for plays fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide data and insight into the relationship between launch dates and funding goals on overall outcome ofKickstarter campaigns for plays.This analysis will lead to clearer decision making in starting a kickstarter campaign so that outcomes are met.
## Analysis and Challenges


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

As with any analysis, the most difficult and crucial part is parcing out the data and using that is relevant to your end goals and understanding. This is the most critical part of the challenge. If you don't do this properly, your foundation is wrong and all your analysis will be wrong. You have to really understand what is being asked of you from the client and then understand what the raw data is telling you so you can establish what you can cut out (if any) and what you need to keep. This was a pretty straight forward challenge so I didn't encounter much difficulty. But I would say I could see how in doing this data pull for the client, even though it is what was requested, the full picture of the data and what she could achieve with it is not necessarily met with these charts. I think one of the challenges is knowing when to deliver simply what is asked of you by the client and when to insert your expertise to give the client even more undersatnding and decision making power. 

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The beginning of the year (from January to May) seems to be the best time to launch a campaign. Conversely, Starting a campaign the last 3 months of the year seems to lead to failure. Probably due to the fact that most people are financcially committed to holiday celebrations, presents, travel, etc. and not willing to open their wallets for a play.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Smaller campaigns have a higher success rate, with a steep drop off after 10-15k. There is an interesting climb from 35k-45k, which could just be an outlier. We would have to look at the bid amounts and number of contributors to further analyze. But typically, the larger the campaign goal, the higher the rate of failure.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

Not knowing the number of backers or the amount of the bids. Did plays that started in July succeed because they had one huge investor or because they had many very small investors? This can help when decideding how to start the bidding minimum, how long to run the campaign and what kind of incentives to give to investors. Also, what about regional data?  Knowing where the most support will come from for plays/theater could help with any marketing done to attract bids.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could go back to the raw data and take into account the number of bid, amount of bids and outcomes of plays, this could help us better understand where to start the bids, how many we need, why kickstarters with large goals failed. Was it because of how they parsed out the bids, not enough middle ground for people who wanted to contribute something but didn't meet the minimum requirements for a bid? The way people spend money is so psychologically charged, understanding what turned them away can help make the changes needed to have a successful campaign. I also thikn it would be powerful to overlay the outcomes by launch date with outcomes by goals while including the dollar amount of the successful and failed campaigns. Did the campaigns from January to May that succeeded also have closely aligned monetary goals?
